Hi, welcome to my little piece of the internet!


My name is Mo (Emma) Yu. I am a fourth year graduate student in Astronomy at the University of Texas at Austin. I work with Prof. Neal J. Evans II and Prof. Sarah Dodson-Robinson on the origin of planetary systems. I use numerical simulations to study the dynamics and chemistry of protoplanetary disks, and seek for spectral signatures that trace the conditions of planet-forming disk midplanes. 

I enjoy sharing my enthusiasm in Science with the community, from elementary school students to high school teachers. 

When not doing Astronomy or programing, I enjoy traveling, dancing, cooking, reading, and keeping learning new things.
