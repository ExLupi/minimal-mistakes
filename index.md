### Hi, welcome to my little piece of the internet!

My name is Mo (Emma) Yu. I am a fifth year graduate student in Astronomy at the University of Texas at Austin. I work with Prof. Neal J. Evans II and Prof. Sarah Dodson-Robinson on the origin of planetary systems. I use numerical simulations to study the dynamics and chemistry of protoplanetary disks, and seek for spectral signatures that trace the conditions of planet-forming disk midplanes.
